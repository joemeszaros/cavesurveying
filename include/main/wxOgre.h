    @brief WX widget for and Ogre rendering window
 
    This WX widget is a self-contained SINGLETON Ogre rendering window; 
    meaning it contains all Ogre objects necessary to create a rendering 
    window and currently supports only one rendering window at a time!
    This is due to the limitation of the self contained class.
 
    @usage Simply create a new wxOgre object and pass a wxFrame as its 
    parent window. Then work with it just like ay other wxControl object.
    It can even be passed to an wxAUI pane.

        /**
        @remarks
        Why do we do this? Well, it's because the Singleton
        implementation is in a .h file, which means it gets compiled
        into anybody who includes it. This is needed for the
        Singleton template to work, but we actually only want it
        compiled into the implementation of the class based on the
        Singleton, not all of them. If we don't change this, we get
        link errors when trying to use the Singleton-based class from
        an outside dll.
        @par
        This method just delegates to the template version anyway,
        but the implementation stays in this single compilation unit,
        preventing link errors.
